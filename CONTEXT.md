# Mithril Codebase Context (Quick Orientation)

This file is a lightweight entry point to the repo and how to approach changes.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL INVARIANT - NEVER VIOLATE ⚠️

**Mithril MUST produce EXACTLY the same state changes as mainnet for every single block.**

This is non-negotiable. Mithril is a verifying full node - its entire purpose is to independently verify that blocks are correct by reproducing the exact same state transitions.

**Divergence = Broken.** There is no such thing as "acceptable" divergence or "close enough":
- Each block must produce byte-for-byte identical account state changes
- Each block's bank hash must match mainnet exactly
- If Block N diverges, every subsequent block will also fail

**Before ANY change, verify:** Does this produce identical state to Agave/Firedancer at the same slot?

---

## AI Guidelines

1. **Validate behavior against Agave and Firedancer** - cite `file:line` references
2. **If unsure, say so explicitly** and propose a concrete verification step
3. **Always include slot/epoch context** for boundary-sensitive values
4. **Proactively note** (when confidence is medium-high or higher):
   - Areas where performance could be improved
   - Potential bugs or edge cases that could be avoided
   - Comments or code that appears outdated and could be removed
5. **Help maintain readable code**:
   - Add clear commentary (Firedancer-style) to well-validated code that gets tested and merged
   - Ask if more context/comments would help when exploring areas that lack documentation
   - Goal: make the codebase self-documenting and easy to understand
6. **Flag dependency changes clearly**:
   - If a change adds a new library that overlaps with an existing dependency, call it out explicitly
   - State whether the intent is to replace the existing library or if this creates redundancy
   - Example: "This adds a new chacha library - are we replacing the existing one or keeping both?"

### Review Request Template

```
You are reviewing Mithril for Agave/Firedancer parity.
Goal: <exact target behavior>.
Context: snapshot slot S, boundary slot B, first reward slot F, epoch E.
Branch/commit: <hash>. Logs: <paste 5–15 lines>.
Code pointers: <file:line>, <file:line>.

Please:
1) List likely causes in priority order (with confidence).
2) For each cause, point to FD/Agave code paths and our code paths.
3) Propose the minimal fix + how to verify it.
4) If unsure, say so and give a concrete test/diagnostic.
```

## Change Approach (Alignment First)

- When in doubt, validate behavior against Agave and Firedancer code.
- If unsure, say so explicitly and propose a concrete verification step.
- Always note which slot/epoch a value comes from. Most mismatches trace back to slot confusion.
- Note if a change may cause performance regression (slower block replay) or increased resource usage (RAM, disk I/O, etc.).
- Keep logs + RPC comparisons as sanity checks.
- Add new design notes to `architecture/` as features stabilize.
